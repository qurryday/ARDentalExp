# DentalExp

# Introduction
Individuals with autism frequently found dental appointments difficult as the experience cannot satisfy their sensory needs. We identified significant challenges faced during dental care visits, including difficulties in navigating hospital corridors, heightened anxiety while seated in dental chairs, and apprehension towards dental instruments. A common issue among many participants was sensory processing disorder (SPD), manifesting as either an increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli like sound and light, or a decreased sensitivity necessitating constant sensory input. To address these challenges, we developed innovative interfaces with an intelligent sensory slider. This tool allows for the adjustment of AR animations within hospital corridors and on dental chairs, aiding in emotional regulation. We also integrated a real-time gesture feedback system, enhancing the dental care experience through customization to meet diverse sensory needs. This approach aims to make dental visits more accommodating and less stressful for individuals with autism, ultimately fostering a more inclusive healthcare environment.
